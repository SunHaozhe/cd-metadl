        "The goal of this competition is to produce a **Learner** that can quickly adapt to new tasks from multiple domains using only a few examples. Thus, you will have to tackle the **any-way any-shot learning problem**. The few-shot learning problems are often referred as *N*-way *k*-shots problems. This name refers to the configuration of the tasks at **meta-test time**. Each task consists of a small training set and a small test set, referred to as **support** and **query** sets, respectively. The number of **ways** *N* denotes the number of classes in a task that represents an image classification problem. The number of **shots** *k* denotes the number of examples per class in the **support set**. In our case, we focus on the **any-way any-shot** setting. In other words, the tasks at meta-test time represent image classification problems with a number of classes varying from 2 to 20, and the **support set** contains 1 to 20 labeled examples per class, *i.e.*, $N \\in [2, 20]$, and $k \\in [1, 20]$. Moreover, as this is a Cross-Domain competition, the tasks are drawn from one of 10 datasets from different domains. Thus, at meta-test time, your submission may be tested in the following way:\n",
        "- **Test task 1:** 5-ways 1-shot task from Dataset 9.\n",
        "- **Test task 2:** 3-ways 15-shots task from Dataset 3.\n",
        "- **Test task 3:** 12-ways 4-shots task from Dataset 9.\n",

        "Tasks are individual mini classification problems defined in the few-shot learning setting we are considering in this challenge. The meta-testing data will always be split into tasks. However, you have a choice to either split the meta-training data also into tasks or split it into batches (similarly to what is usually done in \"regular\" learning problems).\n",

        "**Task:** It represents a ***N*-way *k*-shot task** and it is defined as $ \\mathcal{T_j} = \\{ \\mathcal{D}_{\\mathcal{T_j}}^{train}, \\mathcal{D}_{\\mathcal{T_j}}^{test}\\}$, where $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathcal{T_j}}^{train}$ corresponds to the *support set* that contains *N* classes (ways) and *k* examples per class (shots) for the *j*th task $\\mathcal{T_j}$, and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathcal{T_j}}^{test}$ is the *query set* that contains the labeled test examples of the same *N* classes for $\\mathcal{T_j}$. Since this competition is focused on the cross-domain few-shot learning setting, the data contained in one task belongs strictly to one dataset, but different tasks may come from different datasets because the meta-training split is composed of multiple datasets, *i.e.*, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{train} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{D}_n\\}$. The number of datasets ($n$) in the meta-training split $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{train}$ depends on the number of datasets you want to use for the meta-validation split. During the **public phase** you will have **5 datasets** that you can use for meta-training and meta-validation (*e.g.*  $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{train} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_1, \\mathcal{D}_2, \\mathcal{D}_3\\}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{valid} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_4, \\mathcal{D}_5\\}$) because the remaining 5 datasets are used for the meta-testing split ($\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{test} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_6, \\dots, \\mathcal{D}_{10}\\}$). However, during the **feedback phase**, you will have **10 datasets** that you can use for meta-training and meta-validation, and during the **final phase**, you will have **20 datasets** for the same purpose. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Batch:** It is a collection of sampled examples from the meta-training data. The meta-training data is first concatenated to create a single large dataset including all classes, from which batches of data are sampled, *i.e.*, $\\mathcal{D}^{train} = concat(\\mathcal{D}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{D}_n)$. As before, the public data is divided into **5 datasets** for the **meta-train split** and **5 datasets** for the **meta-test split** (the meta-train split can be further divided into meta-train and meta-validation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, the methods used to tackle the few-shot learning problem differ in the way the preprocessing layers of the backbone are trained and the type of classifier used. The preprocessing layers (computing a feature embedding) are meta-trained either in an \"episodic\" manner (making use of a split into tasks) or in a \"regular\" batch training manner. Therefore, since you can select the data format during meta-training, you can perform these two meta-training approaches. For example, the [Fine-tuning baseline](#intermediate_finetuning) introduced in the intermediate tutorial uses the regular batch training, but the [Prototypical Networks baseline](#advanced_proto) covered in the next section uses \"episodic\" training.\n",

In the above figure, the projected images correspond to each colored dot (green, orange, and purple); different colors represent different classes. Thus, the figure is showing a 3-ways 5-shots problem since there are 3 classes (colors) with 5 examples per class (dots per color). Additionally, the projection would be in 2 dimensions (2 features).\n",
